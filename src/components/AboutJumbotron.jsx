            <p>
                You've probably been in clutch situations like these before:
                <ul>
                    <li>Inferno, B-Site. Last round of the game. 1 vs 1. An Awper watching from Coffin. You're at low health in Banana with an AK-47 and a Smoke.</li>
                    <li>This is the round which decides whether you win or tie the game and all your teammates are relying on you. </li>
                    <li>You pushed and tried to pre-fire, but you get picked. The game ends on a tie.</li>
                </ul>
                Imagine if you knew a lineup to smoke Coffin that would have put you in a better position.<br />
                Would the outcome of the match been different?<br />
                Just knowing one lineup is game changing enough, but knowing multiple would make you an all around great player.
